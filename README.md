Oh man, just got out of Antes del cuerpo and honestly, I feel like my brain's been put through a blender on high speed. My back's all stiff from sitting too long — gotta hit the gym, I guess, or get a better chair. The theater was a circus, popcorn crumbs everywhere, can still feel three pieces in my lap, maybe four.

But the movie, wow, it was like... you know that feeling when you’re trying to remember a dream but it keeps slipping away like a bar of soap in the shower? That’s this movie! The colors hit you like a neon explosion, and the music -- like a jazz band fighting in a thunderstorm. It's intense, right from the first scene. This actor, the one with the hat, he does this thing with his eyes – like he sees through the screen and right into your guilty pleasures.

> I remember this one scene where they're all just standing in the rain, completely drenched. My mind kept wandering, imagining the absurdity of it all being shot in a kiddie pool somewhere in Hollywood. You ever try watching a movie in reverse to catch faux pas? I haven't, but this one tempts me to. You know, download the movie, see it tear itself apart.

There was this voiceover narrating at times, felt like listening to a podcast played over a lost radio frequency. Like instructions for folding origami while parachuting. That one time with the cat on the windowsill? Random and absolutely genius or maybe just stupid? There's some genius stupidity in randomness.

Someone said you gotta watch the movie just for the last ten minutes. Can't say I agree but also can't say I don't. The entire third act is like trying to explain a magic trick to a goldfish. But that one shot of the clock — my god, if clocks could talk, they’d spill the gossip of the universe.

For some reason, now I gotta remind you to maybe not download the movie if you’re expecting a straightforward plot – it’s like trying to use chopsticks to eat soup, man. Let it spill. If Kafka and Dali made a salad together, this is like the dressing, the bits that drip over the edges in patterns only you can see in your own mind's eye.

Haha, whoops, not sure how that got there. Blame it on the chaos in the theater today.
